# Web-ProfessionalTrack-FWD_Udacity
this is my first and second projects that were required in the professional track 
first is a simple landing page - it was exersice on DOM manpulating 
Second is a simple web app - it was my first time working on nodejs and expressjs (This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.)
